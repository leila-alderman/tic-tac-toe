## Using this code

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked reposity onto your local computer.
3. To play the game, `cd` into the project folder and type `ruby lib/tic-tac-toe.rb`.
4. To run the tests, you need to have `rspec` installed.
  - First, check to see if `rspec` is already installed by typing `rspec --version` into the command line.
  - If the response is similar to the following, then you already have `rspec` installed and can continue.
 ~~~bash
 RSpec 3.8
  - rspec-core 3.8.0
  - rspec-expectations 3.8.2
  - rspec-mocks 3.8.0
  - rspec-support 3.8.0

  - If you do not see output similar to the above, then you need to install `rspec` by typing `gem install rspec` into the command line.
 - Now, run `rspec --version` again to ensure that it installed correctly.
5. Use`cd` to move into the main directory and then run `rspec` to show the tests.
